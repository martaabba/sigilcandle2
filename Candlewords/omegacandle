New candle stuff! So this is a little opulent, but I've decided to start making and selling a new line of ultra-premium candles I unironically call "The Omega Collection."
These boxes are solid marble and are the most gorgeous things I've ever seen in my miserable life. 
They weigh about ten pounds and were designed by Eduardo Garza. 
I've decided to turn them into high end candles that look amazing on a night side stand.
The candles are double wicked and the marble top immediately extinguishes the candle with no smoke.
The burn time is approximately 120 hours. Upon its completion, I will pick it up, thoroughly clean it, and return it.
The box itself is gorgeous and can be kept for home use or made back into a candle for $20 as many times as you want.
This is a little crazy, but I think this is what Kelly Godell meant when she told me to upgrade my packaging.
Anyway the small boxes are $100 and the bigger one with the rock formation is $120.
A reminder that if you place an order of $50 or more with me you get a free candle and free delivery.
Post comments with any questions. Happy Friday!
