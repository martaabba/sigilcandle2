I have split my candles into two categories, Sexy and Crisp.
Sexy candles are for bedrooms and living rooms, they are sweet, spicy and dark.
Crisp candles are for bathrooms and kitchens, they are sharp and clean.
SEXY:
Vanilla: Vanilla is my most popular candle. Not many people understand why that is until they smell it. 
Dark tahitian vanila beans are distilled into an oil that is so thick and fragrant I have to handle it with gloves. 
No lie. It smells like leather and sugar, and anyone who has ever smelled it has had a very large reaction.
Sandalwood: A new addition! Sandalwood is sweeter than people think it is, so it's been difficult to market 
it to people who have an (incorrect) expectation of what it smells like. 
I have attempted to sell Sandalwood before but the perceived smell vs the actual smell has always been a problem. 
Thankfully my supplier seemed to also find this an issue and they sent me a free sample of their new sandalwood oil 
and I feel like it's finally ready to sell again. It's the perfect meld of expectations and reality. Sandalwood is 
mysterious, floral, outdoorsy and sexy as hell.
Cinnamon: Cinnamon is much like vanilla to people I meet. They don't understand how amazing cinnamon smells until they 
take the lid off for the first time. Cinnamon is a powerful scent that fills a room very quickly. It is spicy and warm 
and smells like Christmas in the spring.
Tobacco and Lace: My most unique proprietary scent. This one is my own concoction and has many different notes. Last year
I started mixing scents together to try to create something new. And I sure did. Most of them were NOT GREAT. But Tobacco
and Lace was an immediate hit. T&L has been described as a lot of things. It has elements of Tobacco (duh), Stargazer flowers, 
Vanilla and lemon. The scent profile is dense and complicated, but the scent itself is sexy and inviting. My favorite 
bedroom candle. Special thanks to Caitlin Margo Fisher-Draeger for naming the candle. :)
That's it for the sexy candles for this season. On to the crisp candles.
CRISP:
Ginger and Lemongrass: Another of my top sellers, These two scents blend perfectly together to create a spicy, lemony wonderland. 
My favorite bathroom candle, Ginger and Lemongrass is an ancient smell, immediately familiar and comforting.
Eucalyptus: The feel better candle. Eucalyptus oil is so powerful that standing over this candle will clear you out like a sauna. 
This is my most heavily scented candle. It is very polarizing, but the people who like it, LOVE IT. Eucalyptus Candles are amazing 
for turning your bathtub into a steam room, and standing over it does wonders for you when you're sick and just about to head out 
the door to rehearsal.
Lavender: The classic. I have always had a big problem with Lavender candles because the scent profile is minor. Lavender scent can
be a little anemic at times, which makes no sense because the plant is SO FRAGRANT. The oil I buy is very thick and very fragrant and 
honestly, it doesn't take much to make your whole house smell like lavender. It's a wonderful kitchen candle, as the scent is fresh 
and complimentary.
