I only sell two sizes of glass candle jars. 8oz and 16oz.
The 8oz candle has a burn time of 80 hours (trim your wicks)
The 16 oz candle has a burn time of 140 hours (which is less, but there's more surface area so the scent is thrown farther).
My 8oz candle (which I call my Small) is $10. 
My 16oz candle (Large) is $20.
I don't want to toot my own horn, but those prices are really great.
